# RoboSapiens Project

This project aims to connect an ESP8266 (ESP12E/F) to a RoboSapiens robot by substituting the IR receiver with the ESP module. Additionally, a microphone will be added to transcribe voice commands using an API. An SD card may be used to store temporary audio before sending it to the API. Once the voice is transcribed, it will be sent to an AI chatbot like ChatGPT or a model from Hugging Face. The ultimate goal is for the AI to control the movements of the robot, potentially by training a specific model for it.

## Features
- Replace IR receiver with ESP8266 (ESP12E/F)
- Add a microphone for voice command transcription
- Use an API for voice transcription
- Store temporary audio on an SD card
- Send transcribed voice to an AI chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT, Hugging Face)
- Future goal: AI-controlled robot movements

## Components
- ESP8266 (ESP12E/F)
- RoboSapiens robot
- Microphone
- SD card (optional)

## Future Work
- Train a specific AI model to control the robot's movements
